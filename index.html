    <h1> Hi, I'm Habby  </h1>
    <div class="prose">
      <p> Former Human Resources Director, podcast listener, and nature lover.  One of the many hats I wore
        in my former position was a web designer. I took it upon myself to revamp our very outdated, dysfunctional
        company website, with the help of a professional web developer, of course!  This ignited my passion for
        technology and design layout. A short time, I was inspired by an NPR segment about an organization called
        Girls Who Code.  I was hooked and my mind was made to pursue web development. I recently completed a Web
        Development Immersive course at General Assembly and I'm looking for the opportunity to learn, be challenged
        and grow, while doing meaninful work.</p>
